# This could be a fun Python project for groups or events where a random generator is needed.
# It’s useful for conducting lotteries, board games, or just between players to guess a random number.
# Skills used: Getting familiar with the random function, variables, integers, print, if/else, and while loops.

# Skills to build this project:
# random module
# function
# variables
# intergers
# conditional statements
# loops

# START
# First, we import the "random module".
import random

# define a function for the code.

    print(f"\nWelcome {user_name.title()}, to GUESS THE NUMBER 🧐")
    # variable to keep count
    count = 0
    # Now for the loop.
